The eucalyptus open-source cloud-computing system,"Daniel Nurmi, Rich Wolski, Chris Grzegorczyk, Graziano Obertelli, Sunil Soman, Lamia Youseff, Dmitrii Zagorodnov",In Proceedings of Cloud Computing and Its Applications [Online,"Cloud computing systems fundamentally provide access to large pools of data and computational resources through a variety of interfaces similar in spirit to existing grid and HPC resource management and programming systems. These types of systems offer a new programming target for scalable application developers and have gained popularity over the past few years. However, most cloud computing systems in operation today are proprietary, rely upon infrastructure that is invisible to the research community, or are not explicitly designed to be instrumented and modified by systems researchers. In this work, we present EUCALYPTUS – an opensource software framework for cloud computing that implements what is commonly referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS); systems that give users the ability to run and control entire virtual machine instances deployed across a variety physical resources. We outline the basic principles of the EUCALYPTUS design, detail important operational aspects of the system, and discuss architectural trade-offs that we have made in order to allow Eucalyptus to be portable, modular and simple to use on infrastructure commonly found within academic settings. Finally, we provide evidence that EUCALYPTUS enables users familiar with existing Grid and HPC systems to explore new cloud computing functionality while maintaining access to existing, familiar application development software and Grid middle-ware. 1",https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EE06C2E7678B8D2B260CE0F52F22B60D?doi=10.1.1.155.2753&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"['eucalyptus open-source cloud-computing system', 'computational resource', 'new programming target', 'basic principle', 'variety physical resource', 'scalable application developer', 'system researcher', 'new cloud', 'academic setting', 'past year', 'detail important operational aspect', 'large pool', 'grid middle-ware', 'eucalyptus design', 'discus architectural trade-off', 'hpc system', 'opensource software framework', 'hpc resource management', 'cloud computing', 'operation today', 'familiar application development software', 'entire virtual machine instance', 'research community']",
"Cloud Computing and Emerging IT Platforms: Vision, Hype, and Reality for Delivering Computing as the 5th Utility","Rajkumar Buyya, Chee Shin Yeo, Srikumar Venugopal, James Broberg, Ivona Brandic",2008,"With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water, electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload.

Cloud Computing,"Simon Krogh, Simon Krogh, Cloud Computing, A Social, Relations Perspective",nan,"The second half of the 20th century has been characterized by an explosive development in information technology (Maney, Hamm,  & O'Brien, 2011). Processing power, storage capacity and network bandwidth have increased exponentially, resulting in new possibilities and shifting IT paradigms. In step with technological changes, the paradigmatic pendulum has swung between increased centralization on one side and a focus on distributed computing that pushes IT power out to end users on the other. With the introduction of outsourcing and cloud computing, centralization in large data centers is again dominating the IT scene. In line with the views presented by Nicolas Carr in 2003 (Carr, 2003), it is a popular assumption that cloud computing will be the next utility (like water, electricity and gas) (Buyya, Yeo, Venugopal, Broberg,  & Brandic, 2009). However, this assumption disregards the fact that most IT production environments,  unlike water and power supply, are in a constant state of change driven by new demands from users and the desire to utilize advances in technology. Research in IT outsourcing (ITO)  has documented that social relations play a key role in successful ITO (M. C. Lacity, Khan, & Willcocks, 2009), for instance, in establishing and maintaining trust between the involved parties (Sabherwal, 1999). So far, research in cloud computing has neglected this perspective and focused entirely on aspects relating to technology,  economy, security and legal questions. While the core technologies of cloud computing (e.g. virtualization and workload balancing) are tried and tested, the consequences for IT professionals in the affected IT departments have not been studied in detail.

Cloud Computing,nan,nan,"C loud computing has generated significant interest in both academia and industry, but it’s still an evolving paradigm. Essentially, it aims to consolidate the economic utility model with the evolutionary development of many existing approaches and computing technologies, including distributed services, applications, and in-formation infrastructures consisting of pools of com-puters, networks, and storage resources. Confusion exists in IT communities about how a cloud differs from existing models and how these differences af-fect its adoption. Some see a cloud as a novel technical revolution, while others consider it a natural evolution of technology, economy, and culture.1 Nevertheless, cloud computing is an important paradigm, with the potential to significantly reduce costs through optimization and increased operat-ing and economic efficiencies.1,2 Furthermore, cloud computing could significantly enhance collaboration, agility, and scale, thus enabling a truly global comput-ing model over the Internet infrastructure. However, without appropriate security and privacy solutions designed for clouds, this potentially revolutionizing computing paradigm could become a huge failure.

Basics About Cloud Computing,Grace Lewis,2010,"What is cloud computing and how can an organization decide whether to adopt it? Cloud computing is a distributed computing paradigm that focuses on providing a wide range of users with distributed access to scalable, virtualized hardware and/or software infrastructure over the internet. Despite this rather technical definition, cloud computing is in essence an economic model for a different way to acquire and manage IT resources. An organization needs to weigh the cost, benefits, and risks of cloud computing in determining whether to adopt it as an IT strategy. This paper seeks to help organizations understand cloud computing essentials, including drivers for and barriers to adoption, in support of making decisions about adopting the approach.

ABSTRACT: Nowadays cloud computing is a very latest concept in IT industry due to its different sources everyone is thinking about it that how useful is cloud computing. Cloud computing is only a system on the internet which can run applications and store them. Enterprise cloud computing is the application in which business and consumer both use the process of cloud computing. Normally to run a business application it would take a lot of money and need to pay for the update of software and servers. Nevertheless, in cloud computing it make simpler the whole process it reduced the system and store all the data on one cloud on the internet and shared the data in data center. Where customers and employees of business can easily use without spending any money. So the advantage of cloud computing is cost less and it maintains and update its software itself. They are more secure and reliable due to the policy of username and password to access the application on the cloud computing. User can use the cloud from anywhere and anytime.

Performance Engineering for Cloud Computing,John Murphy,nan,"Abstract. Cloud computing potentially solves some of the major challenges in the engineering of large software systems. With the promise of infinite capacity coupled with the ability to scale at the same speed as the traffic changes, it may appear that performance engineering will become redundant. Organizations might believe that there is no need to plan for the future, to optimize applications, or to worry about efficient operation. This paper argues that cloud computing is an area where performance engineering must be applied and customized. It will not be possible to “cloud wash ” performance engineering by just applying previous methods. Rather it is essential to both understand the differences between the cloud and previous systems, and the applicability of proposed performance engineering methods.",https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EE06C2E7678B8D2B260CE0F52F22B60D?doi=10.1.1.380.3102&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"['cloud computing', 'performance engineering', 'proposed performance engineering method', 'large software system', 'infinite capacity', 'efficient operation', 'previous system', 'wash performance engineering', 'traffic change', 'previous method', 'major challenge']",

Many of the previous attempts at managing vulnerabilities have not been so successful because of the use of taxonomy approach. Few of the recent approaches have used ontologies for vulnerability management. Ontologies are real world concepts that are modelled using an ontology language. Ontologies are more appropriate for vulnerabilities as vulnerabilities can not be strictly classified into hierarchies (taxonomies) and tend to overlap. Ontologies support both these characteristics of vulnerabilities. Cloud computing is redefining the way computers are used.

Decentralization of Cloud Computing Security,"Aaliya Peerzada, Zaid Khan, Prof Supriya Madane",nan,"Abstract- Organisations store client’s data in their internal storage memory and protect these confidential files using firewall, so that it is protected against intruders. They also form policies to avoid disclosure of client’s data by organisational employees. Cloud computing systems store client’s data in the storage space provided by the organisations which are responsible for providing the services of cloud. Service providers must use strong measures to protect their clients ’ data, especially to avoid disclosure of user data by unauthorized employees or insiders. The most common method of privacy is storing the data in encrypted form. If the cloud system is carrying out both the processes, that is, the encryption of client’s data and storage of it, then the system administrators responsible for this process acquire the encrypted data and the keys required for decryption. Thus they can access confidential information without authorization and this poses a risk of information disclosure which is unsuitable from the point of view of cloud system security. This study proposes a security model for cloud computing using two clouds, one responsible for the encryption and decryption of client’s data only and the other responsible for storage of this encrypted data. This can be achieved by integrating the concept of Trusted Computing Platform (TCP). The cloud responsible for the data storage must not store data in plaintext or original form but must store it in encrypted format only, and the cloud responsible for data encryption and decryption (i.e TCP cloud) must delete all data upon the completion of encryption or decryption process and must store only the decryption keys. Both the clouds work in accordance with each other without having any interaction between them. Hence the client’s data is secure from the administrative point of view also.

Failures in Cloud Computing,"Harwinder Singh, Rajeev Bedi",nan,"Abstract — Cloud computing promises a more cost effective enabling technology to outsource storage and computations. Existing approaches for secure outsourcing of data and arbitrary computations are either based on a single tamper-proof hardware, or based on recently proposed fully homomorphic encryption. The hardware based solutions are not scaleable, and fully homomorphic encryption is currently only of theoretical interest and very inefficient. In this paper we propose an architecture for secure outsourcing of data and arbitrary computations to an untrusted commodity cloud. In our approach, the user communicates with a trusted cloud (either a private cloud or built from multiple secure hardware modules) which encrypts and verifies the data stored and operations performed in the untrusted commodity cloud. We split the computations such that the trusted cloud is mostly used for security-critical operations in the less timecritical setup phase, whereas queries to the outsourced data are processed in parallel by the fast commodity cloud on encrypted data.

Load Balancing in cloud computing,"Foram F Kherani, Prof. Jignesh Vania",nan,"Abstract-cloud computing is a structured model that defines computing services, in which data as well as resources are retrieved from cloud service provider via internet through some well formed web-based tool and application. Cloud Computing is nothing but a collection of computing resources and services pooled together and is provided to the users on pay-as-needed basis. Sharing of the group of resources may initiate a problem of availability of these resources causing a situation of deadlock. One way to avoid deadlocks is to distribute the workload of all the VMs among themselves. This is called load balancing. The goal of balancing the load of virtual machines is to reduce energy consumption and provide maximum resource utilization thereby reducing the number of job rejections. As the numbers of users are increasing on the cloud, the load balancing has become the challenge for the cloud provider.

This was time consuming, capital intensive and relatively inflexible. Under the cloud computing model, firms can rent as many virtual machines as they need at any given time, and then either design or use off-the-shelf solutions to integrate company-wide data in order to easily distribute access to users both within and outside of the company firewall. This converts fixed capital costs into variable costs, prevents under and over provisioning, and allows minute by minute flexibly.

Exploring the limits of cloud computing,Victor Delgado,2010,"Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm that, just as electricity was firstly gener-ated at home and evolved to be supplied from a few utility providers, aims to transform com-puting into an utility. It is being forecasted that more and more users will rent computing as a service, moving the processing power and storage to centralized infrastructures rather than located in client hardware. This is already enabling startups and other companies to start web services without having to invest upfront in dedicated infrastructure. Unfortunately, this new model also has some actual and potential drawbacks and remains to be seen whether concentrating computing at a few places is a viable option for everyone. Consumers are not used to renting computing capacity. The question of how to measure performance is already a major issue for cloud computing customers. This thesis demonstrates that current metrics for the performance of offerings by cloud providers are subject to imprecision and variability. Several surveys show that customers are concerned with the difficulty of predicting how the services that they have contracted for will behave.

Recently, the Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ) created a content based image retrieval program that analyzes photos of blood smears to determine if cancer cells are present. However, this application is too computationally intensive for one computer to run in a short time frame, so it has been adapted to use CometCloud, a cloud computing framework developed by the National Science Foundation’s Center for Autonomic Computing at Rutgers University (NSF CAC). This method utilizes multiple servers in the cloud to run the image analysis algorithms and return an accurate result in a reasonable time period. Despite the improvement in execution time, the program would have been too difficult for users to take advantage of because it lacked a simple graphical user interface. To resolve this issue, a web application named CompariCell was created. On CompariCell’s graphical user interface, users select an image and adjust parameters for database comparison.

The wireline and wireless network requirements—e.g., jitter, latency, packet loss, protocol support—for these uses vary, and imply that a variety of network capabilities are sometimes necessary: e.g., MPLS for quality of service via class of service to support interactive high definition video in the cloud; optical transport for native protocols such as Fibre Channel for data integration in hybrid cloud scenarios; route control for country compliance issues. Also, distributed topologies and optimized routing are required due to application latency constraints. Moreover, wireless sensor networks and hybrid cloud scenarios such as cloudbursting that require a variety of complex distributed data approaches are driving new transport requirements: guaranteed bandwidth, dynamic bandwidth on demand, and usage-sensitive pricing for fine-grained quantities and duration of bandwidth. Cloud Computing, either as an integrated service or in support of pure-play customers must drive service providers ’ international telecommunications infrastructure evolution as well as BSS/OSS.",https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EE06C2E7678B8D2B260CE0F52F22B60D?doi=10.1.1.455.9776&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"['cloud computing', 'network implication', 'hybrid cloud scenario', 'optical transport', 'abstract cloud computing', 'sensor network', 'bs os', 'pure-play customer', 'wireless network requirement', 'use case', 'browser-free device apps', 'fibre channel', 'data approach', 'new transport requirement', 'network capability', 'protocol support', 'fine-grained quantity', 'latency constraint', 'country compliance issue', 'usage-sensitive pricing', 'native protocol', 'multimedia endpoint', 'wireless sensor network', 'game console', 'dynamic bandwidth', 'interactive high definition video', 'integrated service', 'packet loss', 'broadening range', 'data integration']",

Resource provisioning for cloud computing,"Ye Hu, Johnny Wong, Gabriel Iszlai, Marin Litoiu","in Proceedings of the 2009 Conference of the Center for Advanced Studies on Collaborative Research (CASCON ’09). ACM, 2009","In resource provisioning for cloud computing, an important issue is how resources may be allocated to an application mix such that the service level agreements (SLAs) of all applications are met. A performance model with two interactive job classes is used to determine the smallest number of servers required to meet the SLAs of both classes. For each class, the SLA is specified by the relationship: Prob [response time ≤ x]  ≥ y. Two server allocation strategies are considered: shared allocation (SA) and dedicated allocation (DA). For the case of FCFS scheduling, analytic results for response time distribution are used to develop a heuristic algorithm that determines an allocation strategy (SA or DA) that requires the smallest number of servers. The effectiveness of this algorithm is evaluated over a range of operating conditions. The performance of SA with non-FCFS scheduling is also investigated. Among the scheduling disciplines considered, a new discipline called probability dependent priority is found to have the best performance in terms of requiring the smallest number of servers. 1",https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EE06C2E7678B8D2B260CE0F52F22B60D?doi=10.1.1.369.9746&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"['cloud computing', 'interactive job class', 'resource provisioning', 'application mix', 'probability dependent priority', 'performance model', 'service level agreement', 'fcfs scheduling', 'important issue', 'allocation strategy', 'prob response time', 'scheduling discipline', 'server allocation strategy', 'heuristic algorithm', 'new discipline', 'response time distribution', 'operating condition', 'non-fcfs scheduling', 'analytic result']",

Utilization Approach for Cloud Computing,J. K. Verma,nan,"Abstract — Last few decades have remained the witness of steeper growth in demand for higher computational power. It is merely due to shift from the industrial age to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) age which was marginally the result of digital revolution. Such trend in demand caused establishment of large-scale data centers situated at geographically apart locations. These large-scale data centers consume a large amount of electrical energy which results into very high operating cost and large amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission due to resource underutilization. We propose MADLVF algorithm to overcome the problems such as resource underutilization, high energy consumption, and large CO2 emissions.

Simple Overview on Cloud Computing,"Jeevana Jammula, Swapna Goud. N, Vishnu Murthy. G",nan,"Abstract: There’s a reason why the buzz around cloud computing never seems to die down — concrete results are replacing the initial hype. Take for example the tech leader Cisco Systems, whose size and success wasn’t enough to shield its internal IT operations from one of the biggest headaches faced by IT managers everywhere. Citing his company’s own experience and corroborating industry studies, Tony West, Cisco vice president and chief technology officer, points out that approximately 70 percent of IT spending goes to just maintaining the existing datacenter environment. Finding the time and allocating the resources for new initiatives that further the organization’s overall success get the leftovers, to the frustration of IT and enterprise managers alike. But thanks to an ambitious private cloud project that began a couple years ago, Cisco is bucking this budgetary tradition. Reduced managerial overhead and other private cloud benefits have shrunk costs for routine maintenance to less than 50 percent of Cisco’s total IT budget, which represents companywide savings of hundreds of millions of dollars. Along with Cisco, many organizations are benefiting from private clouds. They are discovering that for security and compliance, the private cloud trumps the public cloud every time. What’s more, dollars can be saved. As outlined in a 2011 study by the Aberdeen Group, the private cloud saves a total of 12 percent combined annual costs savings over public clouds on a per-application basis.

As with every advance in computing, programming is a fundamental challenge, as the cloud is a concurrent, distributed system running on unreliable hardware and networks. Orleans is a software framework for building reliable, scalable, and elastic cloud applications. Its programming model encourages the use of simple concurrency patterns that are easy to understand and employ correctly. It is based on distributed actorlike components called grains, which are isolated units of state and computation that communicate through asynchronous messages. Within a grain, promises are the mechanism for managing both asynchronous messages and local task-based concurrency. Isolated state and a constrained execution model allow Orleans to persist, migrate, replicate, and reconcile grain state. In addition, Orleans provides lightweight transactions that support a consistent view of state and provide a foundation for automatic error handling and failure recovery. We implemented several applications in Orleans, varying from a messaging-intensive social networking application to a data- and compute-intensive linear algebra computation.

Self-service Cloud Computing,"Shakeel Butt, H. Andrés Lagar-Cavilla,   Abhinav Srivastava ,  Vinod Ganapathy",2012,"Modern cloud computing infrastructures use virtual machine monitors (VMMs) that often include a large and complex administrative domain with privileges to inspect client VM state. Attacks against or misuse of the administrative domain can compromise client security and privacy. Moreover, these VMMs provide clients inflexible control over their own VMs, as a result of which clients have to rely on the cloud provider to deploy useful services, such as VM introspection-based security tools. We introduce a new self-service cloud (SSC) computing model that addresses these two shortcomings. SSC splits administrative privileges between a system-wide domain and per-client administrative domains. Each client can manage and perform privileged system tasks on its own VMs, thereby providing flexibility. The system-wide administrative domain cannot inspect the code, data or computation of client VMs, thereby ensuring security and privacy. SSC also allows providers and clients to establish mutually trusted services that can check regulatory compliance while respecting client privacy.

EMERGING CLOUD COMPUTING,"Abu Sarwar Zamani, Dr. Nassir S. Al-araifi, Dr. Ashit, K.

Ultimately, Service Providers are under pressure to architect their infrastructure to enable real-time end-to-end visibility and dynamic resource management with fine grained control to reduce total cost of ownership while also improving agility.

Agent-Based Cloud Computing,"Kwang Mong Sim, Senior Member",2012,"Abstract—Agent-based cloud computing is concerned with the design and development of software agents for bolstering cloud service discovery, service negotiation, and service composition. The significance of this work is introducing an agent-based paradigm for constructing software tools and testbeds for cloud resource management. The novel contributions of this work include: 1) developing Cloudle: an agent-based search engine for cloud service discovery, 2) showing that agent-based negotiation mechanisms can be effectively adopted for bolstering cloud service negotiation and cloud commerce, and 3) showing that agent-based cooperative problemsolving techniques can be effectively adopted for automating cloud service composition. Cloudle consists of 1) a service discovery agent that consults a cloud ontology for determining the similarities between providers ’ service specifications and consumers ’ service requirements, and 2) multiple cloud crawlers for building its database of services. Cloudle supports three types of reasoning: similarity reasoning, compatibility reasoning, and numerical reasoning. To support cloud commerce, this work devised a complex cloud negotiation mechanism that supports parallel negotiation activities in interrelated markets: a cloud service market between consumer agents and broker agents, and multiple cloud resource markets between broker agents and provider agents. Empirical results show that using the complex cloud negotiation mechanism, agents achieved high utilities and high success rates in negotiating for cloud resources. To automate cloud service composition, agents in this work adopt a focused selection contract net protocol (FSCNP) for dynamically selecting cloud services and use service capability tables (SCTs) to record the list of cloud agents and their services. Empirical results show that using FSCNP and SCTs, agents can successfully compose cloud services by autonomously selecting services.",https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EE06C2E7678B8D2B260CE0F52F22B60D?doi=10.1.1.391.1758&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"['agent-based cloud computing', 'cloud commerce', 'cloud service discovery', 'broker agent', 'cloud service composition', 'complex cloud negotiation mechanism', 'empirical result', 'cloud service', 'high success rate', 'multiple cloud resource market', 'provider agent', 'cloud resource', 'parallel negotiation activity', 'focused selection contract net protocol', 'service composition', 'cloud service negotiation', 'software agent', 'agent-based cooperative problemsolving technique', 'agent-based negotiation mechanism', 'multiple cloud crawler', 'interrelated market', 'cloud resource management', 'cloud ontology', 'abstract agent-based cloud computing', 'consumer service requirement', 'cloud service market', 'software tool', 'consumer agent', 'agent-based search engine', 'compatibility reasoning', 'novel contribution', 'similarity reasoning', 'agent-based paradigm', 'cloud agent', 'numerical reasoning', 'use service capability table', 'high utility', 'service discovery agent', 'service negotiation']",

CLOUD COMPUTING IN SPACE,"Jiangchuan Huang, Christoph M. Kirsch, Jiangchuan Huang, Christoph M. Kirsch, Raja Sengupta",nan,"Abstract—We apply virtual machine abstractions to networked autonomous vehicles enabling what we call cloud computing in space. In analogy to traditional system virtualization and cloud computing, there are (customer-operated) virtual vehicles that essentially perform like real vehicles although they are hosted by possibly fewer, shared (provider-operated) real vehicles. Here the focus is, however, on motion rather than computation. In the service-level agreement, a virtual vehicle is a virtual machine plus a virtual speed. We define virtual deadline for each task based on virtual speed, and make the spatial cloud a soft real-time system [7], [1]. The performance isolation is measured by the average of tardiness and delivery probability. We use Voronoi tessellation to allocate the tasks to the real vehicles, and design scheduling policies such as Earliest Virtual Deadline First (EVDF), Earliest Dynamic Virtual Deadline First (EDVDF) and credit scheduling policy for the real vehicles. EVDF is shown to minimize the tardiness. Under EVDF, we identify a worst case arrival process maximizing tardiness. We show in simulation that abstracting real vehicles such as cars or planes to virtual vehicles enables virtual vehicles to move in space like real vehicles with guaranteed tardiness (e.g. ≤ 1%) while being hosted by significantly fewer, e.g. 1-for-7.5, shared real vehicles.

Privacy and Security in Cloud Computing,"Allan A. Friedman, Darrell M.

The shift of each category of user to cloud systems brings a different package of benefits and risks. What remains constant, though, is the tangible and intangible value that the user seeks to protect. For an individual, the value at risk can range from loss of civil liberties to the contents of bank accounts. For a business, the value runs from core trade secrets to continuity of business operations and public reputation. Much of this is hard to estimate and translate into standard metrics of value (Lev, 2003) The task in this transition is to compare the opportunities of cloud adoption with the risks. The benefits of cloud have been discussed elsewhere, to the individual to the enterprise, and to the government (West, 2010a, 2010b). This document explores how to think about privacy and security on the cloud. It is not intended to be a catalog of cloud threats (see ENISA (2009) for an example of rigorous exploration of the risks of cloud adoption to specific groups). We frame the set of concerns for the cloud and highlight what is new and what is not. We analyze a set of policy issues that represent systematic concerns deserving the attention of policy-makers.

Cloud computing with the Azure platform,Jouni Mäenpää,nan,"Software industry is heading towards centralized computing. Due to this trend data and programs are being taken away from traditional desktop PCs and placed in compute clouds instead. Compute clouds are enormous server farms packed with computing power and storage space accessible through the Internet. Instead of having to manage one’s own infras-tructure to run applications, server time and storage space can can be bought from an external service provider. From the customers ’ point of view the benefit behind this idea is to be able to dynamically adjust computing power up or down to meet the demand for that power at a particular moment. This kind of flexibility not only ensures that no costs are in-curred by excess processing capacity, but also enables hard-ware infrastructure to scale up with business growth. Be-cause of growing interest in taking advantage of cloud com-puting a number of service providers are working on provid-ing cloud services. As stated in [7], Amazon, Salerforce.com and Google are examples of firms that already have working solutions on the market. Recently also Microsoft released a preview version of its cloud platform called the Azure. Early adopters can test the platform and development tools free of charge.[2, 3, 4] The main purpose of this paper is to shed light on the inter-nals of Microsoft’s Azure platform. In addition to examining how Azure platform works, the benefits of Azure platform are explored. The most important benefit in Microsoft’s solu-tion is that it resembles existing Windows environment a lot. Developers can use the same application programming inter-faces (APIs) and development tools they are already used to. The second benefit is that migrating applications to cloud is easy. This partially stems from the fact that Azure’s services can be exploited by an application whether it is run locally or in the cloud.",https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EE06C2E7678B8D2B260CE0F52F22B60D?doi=10.1.1.535.2516&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"['azure platform', 'compute cloud', 'development tool', 'storage space', 'important benefit', 'main purpose', 'provid-ing cloud service', 'trend data', 'preview version', 'server time', 'azure platform work', 'window environment', 'service provider', 'microsoft solu-tion', 'external service provider', 'particular moment', 'customer point', 'enormous server farm', 'business growth', 'early adopter', 'excess processing capacity', 'second benefit', 'hard-ware infrastructure', 'software industry', 'microsoft azure platform', 'cloud platform', 'traditional desktop pc']",

CLOUD COMPUTING ADOPTION MOTIVATION IN THE,"European North, South",nan,"The European North-South divide has been one of the most important and widely debated problems of Europe for long time. The countries of the European South have for decades lower levels of economic and technological development and performance than the countries of the European North; though there has been a convergence between the European North and South for some time, recently, due to the economic crisis, this trend has stopped, and on the contrary a divergence is observed. It is widely recognized that in order to overcome this negative situation, and achieve a gradual convergence be-tween these two regions, it is important not only to cut wages and public expenditure in the European South (which has been the dominant approach so far), but also to make wider and better use of new technologies and boost innovation. This paper contributes in this direction, comparing empirically the European North and South with respect to one of the most important, innovative and disruptive new information and communication technologies (ICT): the cloud computing (CC).

Characterizing Cloud Computing Hardware Reliability,Kashi Venkatesh Vishwanath,nan,"Modern day datacenters host hundreds of thousands of servers that coordinate tasks in order to deliver highly available cloud computing services. These servers consist of multiple hard disks, memory modules, network cards, processors etc., each of which while carefully engineered are capable of failing. While the probability of seeing any such failure in the lifetime (typically 3-5 years in industry) of a server can be somewhat small, these numbers get magnified across all devices hosted in a datacenter. At such a large scale, hardware component failure is the norm rather than an exception. Hardware failure can lead to a degradation in performance to end-users and can result in losses to the business. A sound understanding of the numbers as well as the causes behind these failures helps improve operational experience by not only allowing us to be better equipped to tolerate failures but also to bring down the hardware cost through engineering, directly leading to a saving for the company. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to study server failures and hardware repairs for large datacenters.

Simplifying Complex Tasks: Cloud Computing,"V. Kishore, G. G. G. Bhavani, M. Ramakrishna",nan,"Abstract: In a remarkably short time, cloud computing has emerged as a hugely important evolution in the way that businesses and individuals consume and operate computing. It’s a fundamental shift to an operational model in which applications don’t live out their lives on a specific piece of hardware and in which resources are more flexibly deployed than was the historical norm. It’s also a fundamental shift to a development and consumption model that replaces hardwired, proprietary connections among software components and the consumers of those components with lightweight web services and web-based software access. In short, cloud computing refers to a convergence of technologies and trends that are making IT infrastructures and applications more dynamic, more modular, and more consumable. That’s a big change that has implications that touch on just about every aspect of computing. For end-user customers, cloud computing provides the means to ramp up new services or reallocate computing resources rapidly, based on business needs. It means having the ability to run an application either on-premises or off-premises (or a combination of the two) based on cost, capacity requirements, and other factors. This paper strives to compare and contrast Cloud Computing with Grid Computing from various angles and give insights into the essential characteristics of cloud computing. And also to make sense of it all for readers that haven’t been deeply involved in the details of cloud computing as it has rapidly evolved. It lays out the characteristics of a cloud computing infrastructure.

Enabling public verifiability and data dynamics for storage security in cloud computing,"Qian Wang, Cong Wang, Jin Li, Kui Ren, Wenjing Lou",2009,"Abstract. Cloud Computing has been envisioned as the next-generation architecture of IT Enterprise. It moves the application software and databases to the centralized large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique paradigm brings about many new security challenges, which have not been well understood. This work studies the problem of ensuring the integrity of data storage in Cloud Computing. In particular, we consider the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the cloud client, to verify the integrity of the dynamic data stored in the cloud. The introduction of TPA eliminates the involvement of client through the auditing of whether his data stored in the cloud is indeed intact, which can be important in achieving economies of scale for Cloud Computing. The support for data dynamics via the most general forms of data operation, such as block modification, insertion and deletion, is also a significant step toward practicality, since services in Cloud Computing are not limited to archive or backup data only. While prior works on ensuring remote data integrity often lacks the support of either public verifiability or dynamic data operations, this paper achieves both. We first identify the difficulties and potential security problems of direct extensions with fully dynamic data updates from prior works and then show how to construct an elegant verification scheme for seamless integration of these two salient features in our protocol design. In particular, to achieve efficient data dynamics, we improve the Proof of Retrievability model [1] by manipulating the classic Merkle Hash Tree (MHT) construction for block tag authentication. Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme is highly efficient and provably secure. 1",https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EE06C2E7678B8D2B260CE0F52F22B60D?doi=10.1.1.215.7094&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"['cloud computing', 'public verifiability', 'data dynamic', 'storage security', 'prior work', 'data storage', 'seamless integration', 'direct extension', 'general form', 'block modification', 'retrievability model', 'protocol design', 'next-generation architecture', 'application software', 'dynamic data update', 'significant step', 'performance analysis show', 'large data center', 'extensive security', 'dynamic data', 'unique paradigm brings', 'efficient data dynamic', 'salient feature', 'cloud client', 'third party auditor', 'block tag authentication', 'many new security challenge', 'data operation', 'classic merkle hash tree', 'dynamic data operation', 'remote data integrity', 'potential security problem', 'work study', 'elegant verification scheme']",

Cloud computing and the DNA data race,"Michael C. Schatz, Ben Langmead, Steven L. Salzberg",2010,"In the race between DNA sequencing throughput and computer speed, sequencing is winning by a mile. Sequencing throughput has recently been improving at a rate of about 5-fold per year1, while computer performance generally follows “Moore's Law, ” doubling only every 18 or 24 months2. As this gap widens, the question of how to design higher-throughput analysis pipelines becomes critical. If analysis throughput fails to turn the corner, research projects will continually stall until analyses catch up. How do we close the gap? One option is to invent algorithms that make better use of a fixed amount of computing power. Unfortunately, algorithmic breakthroughs of this kind, like scientific breakthroughs, are difficult to plan or foresee. A more practical option is to concentrate on developing methods that make better use of multiple computers and processers. When many computer processors work together in parallel, a software program can often finish in significantly less time.

High energy consumption not only translates to high operational cost, which reduces the profit margin of Cloud providers, but also leads to high carbon emissions which is not environmentally friendly. Hence, energy-efficient solutions are required to minimize the impact of Cloud computing on the environment. In order to design such solutions, deep analysis of Cloud is required with respect to their power efficiency. Thus, in this chapter, we discuss various elements of Clouds which contribute to the total energy consumption and how it is addressed in the literature.

Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the Internet on an as-needed basis, one of the important feature of the cloud services is that users ’ data is usually processed remotely in unknown machines that users do not own or operate. Furthermore, users may not know the machines which actually process and crowd their data. While enjoying the convenience brought by this kind of new tool, users also start disturbing about losing control of their own data. The data processed on clouds are often outsourced, leading to a number of issues related to accountability, including the handling of personally identifiable information.

System is less reliable if it exhibits a degree of hardware and software dependency and more reliable if hardware and software failure occur independently. In Cloud computing environment, hundreds of thousands of systems are hosted that consume cloud computing services. These services have of lots of hardware, software platform and infrastructure support, each of which though carefully engineered are still capable of failure.

Review on Modeling and Implementation of Cloud Computing,"Mangesh K. Nichat, Dr. Prashant, V. Ingole",nan,"Abstract —  Cloud computing is an emerging technology. Advances in virtualization, storage, connectivity and processing power are combined to create a new ecosystem for cloud computing. In this paper the concepts of Cloud Computing like type of cloud, cloud deployment models, advantages of using cloud and risks involved in it are analysed. This paper tries to bring awareness among managers and computing professionals to use Cloud computing as an alternative to large in-house data centres. The current approaches to enabling real-time, dynamic infrastructure are inadequate, expensive and not scalable to support consumer mass-market requirements. Over time, the server-centric infrastructure management systems have evolved to become a complex tangle of layered systems designed to automate systems administration functions that are knowledge and labour intensive. This expensive and non-real time paradigm is ill suited for a world where customers are demanding communication, collaboration and commerce at the speed of light.

Formalising trust as a computational concept,Stephen Paul Marsh,1994,"Trust is a judgement of unquestionable utility — as humans we use it every day of our lives. However, trust has suffered from an imperfect understanding, a plethora of definitions, and informal use in the literature and in everyday life. It is common to say “I trust you, ” but what does that mean? This thesis provides a clarification of trust. We present a formalism for trust which provides us with a tool for precise discussion. The formalism is implementable: it can be embedded in an artificial agent, enabling the agent to make trust-based decisions. Its applicability in the domain of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is raised. The thesis presents a testbed populated by simple trusting agents which substantiates the utility of the formalism. The formalism provides a step in the direction of a proper understanding and definition of human trust. A contribution of the thesis is its detailed exploration of the possibilities of future work in the area. Summary 1. Overview This thesis presents an overview of trust as a social phenomenon and discusses it formally. It argues that trust is: • A means for understanding and adapting to the complexity of the environment. • A means of providing added robustness to independent agents. • A useful judgement in the light of experience of the behaviour of others. • Applicable to inanimate others. The thesis argues these points from the point of view of artificial agents. Trust in an artificial agent is a means of providing an additional tool for the consideration of other agents and the environment in which it exists. Moreover, a formalisation of trust enables the embedding of the concept into an artificial agent. This has been done, and is documented in the thesis. 2. Exposition There are places in the thesis where it is necessary to give a broad outline before going deeper. In consequence it may seem that the subject is not receiving a thorough treatment, or that too much is being discussed at one time! (This is particularly apparent in the first and second chapters.)

THE ORGANIZING VISION FOR CLOUD COMPUTING IN TAIWAN,"Shirley Ou Yang, Carol Hsu",nan,"Cloud Computing has attracted increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners as a new paradigm of information technology. Many recent studies on technological innovation have focused on two confronting models: rational-actor decision and social construction. However, both models are rarely used at the industry level of analysis. This paper adopts the lens of organizing vision, and presents a secondary analysis on the institutional processes of the forming of the Cloud Computing industry in Taiwan. In doing so it examines several key institutional forces, including (1) community discourse, structure, and commerce; (2) IS practitioner subculture; (3) adoption of core technology; and (4) adoption and diffusion. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of institutionalization of society and technology in the collective sense better explain the formation of the Cloud Computing industry embedded in a large community network than the linear rational choice paradigm. These findings also suggest that decision makers in both the private and public sector should be more aware of the institutional forces that motivate them to adopt IT innovation.",https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EE06C2E7678B8D2B260CE0F52F22B60D?doi=10.1.1.469.7419&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"['organizing vision cloud computing taiwan', 'cloud computing industry', 'collective sense', 'technological innovation', 'large community network', 'core technology', 'institutional process', 'public sector', 'rational-actor decision', 'decision maker', 'several key institutional force', 'secondary analysis', 'new paradigm', 'social construction', 'industry level', 'institutional force', 'many recent study', 'information technology', 'linear rational choice paradigm', 'practitioner subculture', 'cloud computing', 'community discourse']",

Role of Biometric Cryptography in Cloud Computing,"Praveen Tiwari, Srinagar Garhwal, Ashis Saklani, Srinagar Garhwal",nan,"Cloud Computing presents a distinct way to share distributed resources and services with the help of internet.

A secure data transmission and key management is needed in cloud computing, to overcome such problems. Securing information is the key issue in the field of network security. Cryptography is one of the most effective way to enhance information security. Biometric cryptography is a technique which uses biometric features to encrypt the data and overcome the defects of traditional cryptography. In this paper, a biometric based encryption and decryption scheme, in which a master key is generated using whole/partial hash portion of combined sender and receiver finger print. From this master key many random keys are generated using pseudo random generator which is used as a secret key for both encryption and decryption. The pseudo random number generator may have different algorithm to generate one dimensional number from a piece of image matrix of biometry. This one dimensional number is considered as master key and remains valid for one session unless renewed. This master key and sequence number (seed value, other parameter) is sent by the sender after watermarking it in sender’s fingerprint along with encrypted message.

Information flow control in cloud computing,"Ruoyu Wu, Gail-joon Ahnl, Hongxin Hul, Mukesh Singhal",2010,"Abstract-Cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm where computing resources are provided as services over Internet while residing in a large data center. Even though it enables us to dynamically provide servers with the ability to address a wide range of needs, this paradigm brings forth many new challenges for the data security and access control as users outsource their sensitive data to clouds, which are beyond the same trusted domain as data owners. A fundamental problem is the existence of insecure information flows due to the fact that a service provider can access multiple virtual machines in clouds. Sensitive information may be leaked to unauthorized customers and such critical information flows could raise conflict-of-interest issues in cloud computing. In this paper, we propose an approach to enforce the infor mation flow policies at Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) layer in a cloud computing environment. Especially, we adopt Chinese Wall policies to address the problems of insecure information flow.

Review on Cloud Computing as an Necessity Abstract,A. Azar Mirzaei,nan,"Cloud computing is a phrase used to describe a variety of computing concepts that involve a large number of computers connected through a real-time communication network such as the Internet. In science, cloud computing is a synonym for distributed computing over a network, and means the ability to run a program or application on many connected computers at the same time. The phrase also more commonly refers to network-based services, which appear to be provided by real server hardware, and are in fact served up by virtual hardware, simulated by software running on one or more real machines. Such virtual servers do not physically exist and can therefore be moved around and scaled up on the fly without affecting the end user- arguably, rather like a cloud.",https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EE06C2E7678B8D2B260CE0F52F22B60D?doi=10.1.1.403.8126&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"['cloud computing', 'necessity abstract', 'distributed computing', 'network-based service', 'real-time communication network', 'virtual server', 'virtual hardware', 'commonly refers', 'large number', 'real server hardware', 'real machine', 'end user']",

SECURITY ALGORITHM IN CLOUD COMPUTING: OVERVIEW,"M. Vijayapriya, M. Phil",nan,"Abstract: Network security is becoming more and more important as people spend more and more time connected. It is a specialized field in computer networking that involves securing a computer network infrastructure. It is typically handled by a network administrator or system administrator who implements the security policy, network software and hardware needed to protect a network and the resources accessed through the network from unauthorized access. It also ensures that we have an adequate access to the network and resources to work. A network security system typically lies on the layers of protection and consists of multiple components including networking monitoring and security software in addition to hardware and the appliances. All components work together to increase the overall security of the computer network. For enhancing the security, many algorithms are widely used. Cloud Computing is a set of IT based Services that are provided to a customer over a network and these services are delivered by a third party provider who owns the infrastructure. It is often provided ""as a service "" over the Internet and that was typically in the form of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS), data storage as a service (DSaaS).

Multi-Core Scheduling in Cloud Computing,"Abhishek Kaushik, Inderveer Chana",nan,"ABSTRACT – I.T. industry keeps on looking for high processing power, the reason behind the introduction of multi-core processors. Cloud computing is also to adopting multi-core processors. Prologue of multi-core processors in cloud computing comes with discrepancies, one of which is resource scheduling. The virtual machine that runs on cloud fights for the core in multi-core processors. This leads to problems like starvation and underutilization. There are several techniques for multi-core resource scheduling but none of present techniques focuses on resource scheduling of multi-core processors especially in cloud environment. A new approach is proposed in this paper which overcomes the problems which occurs when present multi-core resource scheduling techniques compared in the cloud environment.",https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EE06C2E7678B8D2B260CE0F52F22B60D?doi=10.1.1.402.2246&rep=rep1&type=pdf,"['multi-core processor', 'cloud computing', 'multi-core scheduling', 'cloud environment', 'virtual machine', 'present technique', 'several technique', 'new approach', 'multi-core resource', 'resource scheduling', 'high processing power', 'abstract i.t. industry', 'cloud fight']",

Validating Metering and Billing In Cloud Computing,Jasjit Singh Samagh,nan,"Cloud Computing is a new class of network based computing that takes place over the Internet. Cloud computing has changed everyone’s thought of infrastructure, architecture, software, delivery systems etc. With the development of this technology security issues are seriously raising its head. In order to address such security issues many steps have been taken by the cloud providers. Among the security issues, billing verification method play an important role by which the service user can ascertain that the charges being made by the cloud provider for computational purpose is in accordance with the amount of work done by him. In view of above I propose solution for achieving security on metering and billing procedure. By the use of this method the chances of billing being tempered by the cloud provider become negligible.
